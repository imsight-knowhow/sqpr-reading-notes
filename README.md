# SpQR Reading Notes

Investigation and reading notes for the paper: **SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression**

## Paper Overview

SpQR is a compression technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) that achieves near-lossless compression by combining sparse and quantized representations.
