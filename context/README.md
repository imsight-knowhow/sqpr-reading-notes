## Content
This directory is a centralized knowledge base to support AI-assisted development on this project. It groups design docs, hints, instructions, issues, logs, plans, reference code, role definitions, summaries, tasks, and tools in a consistent structure.

Each top-level subdirectory contains its own `README.md` explaining what belongs there and how it should be used. New context documents placed here should follow the header template described in `magic-context/instructions/dir-setup/make-context-dir.md`.
